Collaboration: Ishaan Chainani. We worked on my laptop and met outside of class

Outside help: Stephen White offered to meet with my partner and I and tutored us
and helped us understand the concept of the game

Bugs: So the files compile, but we did not have time to complete main
and the countNeighbors does not work properly. The commented out part in main
was our first (of many) attempts at this project but realized it would have
be easier if we completed main last. I just kept it in there just because.
We didn't get around to implementing main and completing Grid.cpp
