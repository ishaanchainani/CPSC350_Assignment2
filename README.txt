Collaboration: Ishaan Chainani 
Outside help: Stephen White offered to meet with my partner and I and tutored us
and helped us understand the concept of the game

Bugs: So the files compile, but we did not have time to complete main
and the countNeighbors does not work properly. We wrote out in main what we would
have done but didn't get around to implementing it and completing Grid.cpp
